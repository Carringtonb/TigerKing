# TigerKing

## Description
TigerKing is a fan-made app for Netflix's Tiger King that aims to connect fans of the show to each other and the wider community (and demonstrate the results of our first exploration of Xamarin). Fans can write notes about the show.

Authors: Carrington Beard, Brandon Johnson, and Andrew Casper

[Code used from this Xamarin tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/multi-page?pivots=windows)

(Note: views expressed in this app do not necessarily reflect the views of the authors. It's very possible Carol's husband was killed by a drug cartel in Puerto Rico.)
